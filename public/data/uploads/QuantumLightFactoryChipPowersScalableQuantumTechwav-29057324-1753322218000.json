    "title": "Silicon Chip Breakthrough Integrates Quantum Light and Control for Scalable Quantum Tech",
    "description": "Researchers from Boston University, UC Berkeley, and Northwestern University have developed the first chip that combines quantum light sources and control electronics on a single silicon platform. Using standard semiconductor manufacturing, the chip can reliably generate correlated photon pairs and includes a self-correcting mechanism to stabilize performance. This breakthrough paves the way for scalable, commercial quantum systems beyond laboratory settings.",
