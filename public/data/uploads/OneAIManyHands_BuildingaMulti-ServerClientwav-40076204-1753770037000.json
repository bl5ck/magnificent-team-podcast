    "description": "In the podcast episode \"One AI, Many Hands: Building the Multi-Server MCP Client,\" the speakers explore a groundbreaking architecture for AI tool integration using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Rather than relying on monolithic, single-skill AI systems, MCP introduces a modular design where micro-servers, each handling a specialized task such as web scraping, document parsing, or database access, can work independently yet communicate through a unified standard. This creates a more flexible and maintainable ecosystem, where tools can be swapped or upgraded without disrupting the whole system.",
